<h1>ATLAS Event Aggregation Service</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The ATLAS Event Aggregation Service (UAS) provides a GraphQL API for accessing ATLAS resources and services from the Event Manager Application.
    The api is available at http://hostname:port/event-aggregation/graphql where port is typically 8080 but may be mapped to 80 in K8s.
</p>

<h3>Graphql Playground</h3>
<p>You can access the EAS graphql API through an embedded <a href="https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-playground">Graphql
    Playground</a> client
    by accessing the <a href="/event-aggregation/playground">/playground</a> endpoint on this server. Graphql Playground is an excellent
    tool for testing queries and
    other features of the hosted schema.</p>
