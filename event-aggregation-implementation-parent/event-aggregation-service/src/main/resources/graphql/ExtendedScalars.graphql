# This file lists all of the extended scalars that GraphQL-Java provides.
# To use them, select just the ones you want to use in your schema, as you'll have to wire in impementations for any
# that are found in the combined schema, whether they are used or not.
#
# To use a custom scalar, define it in SDL as below, and when creating the RuntimeWiring object, register the scalar
# implementation with RuntimeWiring.newRuntimeWiring().scalar(ExtendedScalars.DateTime) for each scalar used.
#
# These are scalar types defined in the GraphQL-Java Extended Scalars library.
# These definitions are declared here to make them visible to the Intellij GraphQLJS plugin
# for code completion and checking.
